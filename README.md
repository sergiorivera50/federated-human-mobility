# Federated Human Mobility

**Definition of Client:** the venue visited by people.

**Setup:** The task is predicting how many people (optionally filtered by demographics such
as income range, age, gender, etc.) will visit a given venue category within the next x
hours/days. Nearby venues may experience a similar trend in popularity, e.g., if there is a
football match nearby, then all the food places may get more than the usual crowds.

**Input:** The input of our model must be a sequence of user check-ins for a specific venue
Potential architectures and datasets are the same as for project A.1 and A.2

**Why FL?**
- The popularity can be a trade secret for the venues. Visits to certain places (like
hospitals) can be sensitive for people.
- Accuracy-wise, itâ€™ll be better than training models at venues in isolation.
